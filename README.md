# Raft

[MIT's 6.824 (Distributed System)](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/), original code: git://g.csail.mit.edu/6.824-golabs-2016

## Directory Tree
* src/kvraft: a Key-Value store based on Raft
	* apply the Raft to state machines to implement a KV store
	* **NEW FEATURE!:** support log snapshot and compaction
		* based on the algorithm described in [**Log Compaction in Raft**](https://ramcloud.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/6586373/compaction.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1367123151531&api=v2)'s section 5.3 (but my implementation is very naive and simple, it's not very efficient)
	* other reference: [blahgeek's implementation](https://github.com/blahgeek/6.824-golabs/)

* src/raft: implementation of [**The Raft Consensus Algorithm**](http://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/papers/raft-atc14)
	* almost supports all features described in the paper:
		* leader election
		* append entries
		* log consistence
		* recovery after crash
		* resilient to unreliable network such as network partition, message reorder and message lost
	* note1: cluster membership must be static
	* ~~note2: test_test.go is the test file of this project. Please only run part of these test functions at one time, otherwise, it may throw the error of running too many go routines.~~ (Problem of race condition, solved)


* src/mapreduce: MapReduce framework, used for getting familiar with the source and Go.
	* implement sequential and distributed MapReduce framework
	* handle worker failure
	* implement 2 MapReduce task: word-count, and invert-list
